## All buttons

This page is an example on how to document your button components, most of the copy was written by AI so don't take it very seriously.

Find the code for this page in the `src/pages/components/buttons.md` file.

<div class="component-preview">

<ReactSample></ReactSample>
</div>

```js
export default function ReactSample({ children }) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(1);
  return (
    <>
      <h1>111</h1>
    </>
  );
}
```
